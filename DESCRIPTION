Title: Statistical Inference via Randomized Algorithms
Version: 0.1.0
Authors@R: person("Zhixiang", "Zhang", email = "zzxiang710@gmail.com", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: This package implements various statistical inference methods for 
    the deterministic target of a sequence of randomized algorithms as developed 
    in Zhang et al. (2023). These general methods---including sub-randomization, 
    multi-run plug-in, and multi-run aggregation---require the multiple runs of 
    the randomized algorithm. The framework's applicability is demonstrated 
    through inference for least squares parameters via sketch-and-solve, partial 
    sketching, and iterative Hessian sketching. These methods are also applied 
    in stochastic optimization, including SGD with Polyak-Ruppert averaging and 
    momentum-based approaches. The package also incorporates classical pivotal 
    inference methods, supported by newly developed theoretical results for 
    sketched least squares estimators.
